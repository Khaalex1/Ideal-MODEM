# Ideal-MODEM

MATLAB academic project made with my colleague and friend G. GUEGANNO for the Modulation Course taught by Dr. A. MANSOUR at ENSTA Bretagne.


The project consists in realizing an ideal MODEM using the OOK and BPSK principles to transmit and decode a signal.


Tests were made by modifying the MODEM's parameters like the sampling frequency, the SNR, chirp duration etc.


The results, which are summarized in the report (in French), show without surprise that the BPSK modulation is unanimously more efficient than the OOK one. 
However, OOK remains a low cost technique worth to investigate.
